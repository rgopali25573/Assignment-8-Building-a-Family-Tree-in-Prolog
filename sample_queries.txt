% Sample Queries for Family Tree Prolog Program
% This file demonstrates various queries you can run with the family tree implementation

% Basic relationship queries

% 1. Find all parents in the family tree
?- parent(X, Y).
% Expected results: All parent-child pairs defined in the knowledge base

% 2. Find Mary's children
?- child(X, mary).
% Expected results: X = ann ; X = steve

% 3. Find who is James' father
?- father(X, james).
% Expected results: X = john

% 4. Find all mothers in the family tree
?- mother(X, _).
% Expected results: X = susan ; X = mary ; X = patricia

% 5. Find all of Susan's daughters
?- daughter(X, susan).
% Expected results: X = mary

% Extended family relationships

% 6. Find Jennifer's grandparents
?- grandparent(X, jennifer).
% Expected results: X = james ; X = mary ; X = john ; X = susan

% 7. Find all grandfathers
?- grandfather(X, Y).
% Expected results: Multiple solutions showing all grandfather-grandchild relationships

% 8. Find all siblings of Mary
?- sibling(X, mary).
% Expected results: X = james

% 9. Find all brothers in the family
?- brother(X, _).
% Expected results: X = james ; X = steve ; X = michael ; X = robert

% 10. Find Patricia's cousins
?- cousin(X, patricia).
% Expected results: X = ann ; X = steve

% Recursive relationship queries

% 11. Find all ancestors of Jennifer
?- ancestor(X, jennifer).
% Expected results: X = patricia ; X = james ; X = mary ; X = john ; X = susan

% 12. Find all descendants of John
?- descendant(X, john).
% Expected results: X = mary ; X = james ; X = ann ; X = steve ; X = patricia ; X = michael ; X = jennifer ; X = robert ; X = lisa

% Compound queries (using AND, OR)

% 13. Find all males who are also parents
?- male(X), parent(X, _).
% Expected results: X = john ; X = james ; X = michael

% 14. Find all females who are grandparents
?- female(X), grandparent(X, _).
% Expected results: X = susan ; X = mary

% Variable-free queries (testing if a specific relationship exists)

% 15. Is John the grandfather of Patricia?
?- grandfather(john, patricia).
% Expected results: true

% 16. Is Ann a cousin of Michael?
?- cousin(ann, michael).
% Expected results: false

% Finding all solutions with findall/3

% 17. Find all children of Mary and count them
?- findall(X, child(X, mary), Children), length(Children, Count).
% Expected results: Children = [ann, steve], Count = 2

% 18. List all descendants of John
?- findall(X, descendant(X, john), Descendants).
% Expected results: Descendants = [mary, james, ann, steve, patricia, michael, jennifer, robert, lisa]

% Negation queries (using not/1)

% 19. Find all people who are not parents
?- member(X, [john, susan, mary, james, ann, steve, patricia, michael, jennifer, robert, lisa]), not(parent(X, _)).
% Expected results: X = ann ; X = steve ; X = jennifer ; X = robert ; X = lisa

% 20. Find siblings who don't have children
?- sibling(X, _), not(parent(X, _)).
% Expected results: X = ann ; X = steve

% How to run these queries:
% 1. Load your family_tree.pl file in a Prolog interpreter (e.g., SWI-Prolog)
%    ?- [family_tree].
% 2. Type any of the above queries at the Prolog prompt
% 3. Press Enter to see the first solution
% 4. Press ; (semicolon) to see alternative solutions
% 5. Press a (for all) to see all solutions at once
% 6. Press Enter after the last solution or press q to quit the current query
